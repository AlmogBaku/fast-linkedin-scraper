A modern Python library for efficiently scraping LinkedIn.

## Overview

This library provides a high-level API for extracting LinkedIn profile data including work experience, education, and skills. Built with Playwright for reliable browser automation.

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from fast_linkedin_scraper import LinkedInSession

async def main():
    # Using cookie authentication
    async with LinkedInSession.from_cookie(li_at_cookie) as session:
        person = await session.get_profile("https://www.linkedin.com/in/stickerdaniel/")
        print(json.dumps(person.model_dump(), indent=2, default=str))

asyncio.run(main())
```
**Output**
